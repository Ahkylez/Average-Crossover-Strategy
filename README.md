# Moving Average Crossover Strategy

This project implements a **Moving Average Crossover Strategy** using both **Simple Moving Averages (SMA)** and **Exponential Moving Averages (EMA)** to identify buy and sell signals for financial assets.

---

## Objective
To develop and analyze a moving average crossover strategy, demonstrating:
1. **Technical Skills**: Advanced use of Python, data visualization, and financial data analysis.
2. **Quantitative Methods**: Application of statistical and mathematical techniques for trend identification.
3. **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Real-world application of signals for trading decisions.

## Features
### 1. **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**
- SMA smoothens price fluctuations by averaging closing prices over a fixed time period.
- Used to identify general trends in price movements.

### 2. **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**
- EMA assigns more weight to recent prices, reacting faster to price changes.
- Enables quicker identification of trend shifts compared to SMA.

### 3. **Buy/Sell Signal Generation**
- **Buy Signal**: Triggered when the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average.
- **Sell Signal**: Triggered when the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average.

### 4. **Comprehensive Visualizations**
- Dynamic plots display closing prices, moving averages, and buy/sell signals.
- Clear differentiation between SMA and EMA strategies.

### 5. **Performance Metrics**
- Cumulative returns and Sharpe ratio calculations for evaluating strategy effectiveness.
